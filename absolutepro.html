            Apple is the common name for any tree of the genus Malus, of
            the family Rosaceae. Apple trees grow in any of the temperate
            areas of the world. Some apple blossoms are white, but most
            have stripes or tints of rose. Some apple blossoms are bright
            red. Apples have a firm and fleshy structure that grows from
            the blossom. The colors of apples range from green to very
            dark red. The wood of apple trees is fine-grained and hard.
            It is, therefore, good for furniture construction. Apple trees
            have been grown for many centuries. They are propagated by
            grafting because they do not reproduce themselves.
